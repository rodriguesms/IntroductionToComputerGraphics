# Warm up!

All the practical activities are going to be implemented at Javascript using the Three.js library, so this is an optional activity serving as a warm up to the language and the library.

## Javascript activities

### 1 - Write a program that displays the message "Hello World" when run.

### 2 - Write a program that calculates the quantity of pair numbers in an randomly generated array containing ten unsigned integers.

### 3 - Implement the Quicksort algorithm.

### 4 - Create a small Javascript library that defines a Vector class containing three elements and a 3x3 dimension Matrix class. Then, implement the following functions that operates the following tasks among them:

    * Vector norm
    * Cross product between two vectors
    * Dot product between two vectors
    * Vector/Matrix product
    * Matrix/Matrix product
    * Determinant of a matrix
    * Transpose of a matrix
  
### 5 - Create drawings directly in a `<canvas>` HTML element at runtime using Javascript.

## Three.js Activities

### 1 - Write a program that draws a static cube in the browser.

### 2 - Write a program that draws a rotating cube at real time in the browser.

### 3 - Write a program that draws three static cubes in the browser, each one with a distinct appearance (i.e material).
